## TODO
[] Allow users to register / login
[] Visitors can upload a file with their own set expiry time.
[] As soon as a created link is visited, it self deletes.
[] When uploading file, user is asked if they want to PW protect
[] Encrypt all files before storing, decrypt on download.



### Questionable things
- Files may cause an issue for UK hosting, and depends on what the files are etc. Don't want a lawsuit.
- Possibly allow for text?
